## About the Video Course
Puppet is a configuration management system. It is a language written for and by system administrators, to manage a large number of systems efficiently and prevent configuration drift. It automates all your IT configurations, giving you control over what you do to each node, allowing you to decided when and how you do it.

Managing your application's infrastructure requires constant updates and security for infrastructure reliability. Automation provides faster deployments and fewer failures, improves security, and reduces costs for your organization. Puppet is an ideal tool for automating IT infrastructure in your organization and this course will show you how to do this.

The course gives you a hands-on tutorial in the Puppet platform and so you can manage your IT infrastructure. You will build a custom software installation and configuration to match your application infrastructure, and explore the latest Puppet features by executing, testing, and deploying Puppet across your systems. You'll also develop Puppet modules while learning to avoid common errors and overcome everyday challenges.

By the end of this course, you will be confident enough, and have the required skills, to manage your IT infrastructure effectively with Puppet and be ready to use Puppet in your own systems to ensure all of your servers comply with the desired configuration.
